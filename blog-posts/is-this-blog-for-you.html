      <h2>Is this blog for you?</h2>

      <img src="/assets/images/blog-posts/is-this-blog-for-you/featured-image.jpg" width="400">
      <p>So why would you read this blog? Are you happy with your health? Do you have a chronic disease you wish you could manage better? Would you like to reduce the number of medications you take daily? Are you tired of feeling tired all the time? Do you have as much energy as you would like to have? Do you feel older than your biologi jij cal age? Do you sleep well? Do you run out of breath easily? Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to keep that weight off? Do you want to live longer? Do you want to improve your quality of life?</p>

      <p>If any or some of those sound like things you think about, this might just be a great place to explore and learn more.</p>

      <p>My approach to solving any of these problems/questions is slow and sustainable, and going after the root cause(s), to find permanent change. Something I learned from a colleague who is a social worker is the phrase, “all behaviour has meaning”. I believe it is important to discover and find out the meaning underlying each behaviour, so we can be aware of what drives us to do things, which then makes habit change a whole lot easier.</p>

      <p>While each problem above, or each chronic disease is different, there is a lot of common ground amongst them all. And while different habits might need to be broken or formed, a great place to start is to learn more about lifestyle medicine, so we can understand what tools out there could really help any one of us</p>
