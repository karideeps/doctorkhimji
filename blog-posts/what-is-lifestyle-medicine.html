        <p>Who am I and what is this blog?</p>
  
        <p>My name is Dr. Hussain Khimji. I am based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and I am a triple board certified doctor working in Family Medicine, Lifestyle Medicine, and Obesity Medicine.</p>
  
        <p>My passion is lifestyle medicine. What is lifestyle medicine? Lifestyle medicine focuses on treating, preventing, and most importantly REVERSING chronic disease, through 6 key pillars:</p>
  
        <ol>
          <li>Whole Food Plant Predominant Nutrition</li>
          <li>Regular Exercise</li>
          <li>Restorative Sleep</li>
          <li>Stress Management</li>
          <li>Social Connection</li>
          <li>Avoidance of Risky Substances</li>
        </ol>
  
        <p>What are some chronic diseases we can prevent or revers? Think high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia), high blood sugar (diabetes), and obesity. Why is this important? These are known as non-communicable diseases, which ary not necessarily passed between humans the way a viral infection or the flu is, but something that affects us all, whether we realize it or not. And interestingly, it someone were to have all 4 chronic diseases mentioned above, they would have something called metabolic syndrome, which increases our risk of death and further disease (read: heart attack and stroke, etc)- things no one likes to have.</p>
  
        <p>I love lifestyle medicine because its one of the first times we have evidence and scientific research backing the power of how simple (but not easy) lifestyle measures and changes can help us lead happier, healthier, disease free lives.</p>
  
        <p>While this is my passion, I know it can sometimes be scary and daunting to make new habits, especially when old habits are so ingrained or powerful. And even once we do break old habits and make new healthy ones, part two of the challenge is to maintain them.</p>
  
        <p>I hope to share my journey as a fellow human looking to live a healthier, happier, longer, disease free life. If that sounds like something you are interested in, keep on reading!</p>
