        <p>To recap, there are six pillars of Lifestyle Medicine: </p>
  
        <ol>
          <li>Whole Food Plant Predominant Nutrition</li>
          <li>Regular Exercise</li>
          <li>Restorative</li>
          <li>Stress Management</li>
          <li>Social Connection</li>
          <li>Avoidance of Risky Substances</li>
        </ol>
  
        <p>Let’s dive in. Nutrition. You may have heard phrases such as “abs are made in the kitchen” and we “cannot outrun a bad diet”, and while these are sensational and catchy, there is some truth to them. Nutrition is one of the most critical pillars of our health, for myriad reasons. Food is fuel. Food is medicine. </p>
  
        <p>What we put into our bodies, does get reflected back in terms of how we feel, how we function and how healthy or unhealthy we are/may become. It impacts everything from mood to energy levels, to sleep and sexual function, to bowel movements and skin health. And so much more.</p>
  
        <p>Lifestyle Medicine recommends eating more whole foods (or at least minimally processed), more plants (fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, legumes, whole grains), and by default then, less meat, less dairy and less ultra-processed foods. The evidence behind this is available, compelling, and growing. We will get into this more soon, however in a nutshell, adding whole foods and plants, while reducing ultra processed and inflammatory disease driving foods, can make a night and day difference in how we feel and how healthy we are. But you likely already know that, so why are all these diseases becoming more common? And why do we generally as a population feel more unhealthy than ever before? </p>
